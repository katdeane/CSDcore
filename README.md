# CSDcore
The basic scripts for CSD generation. Open the genCSD.m script and have your matlab directory set to this folder. Read the instructions and descriptions therein to generate a CSD from the example LFP generated data or from your own loaded LFP data. 

For questions, contact katrinad@ucr.edu. I'm happy to help more people use CSD analysis. If CSD is used in your published work based on this repository or any of my other repositories, please site a relevant paper from our lab, such as Deane et al 2020, J Physiol. 

Thanks and enjoy!
